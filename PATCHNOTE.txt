=== PATCH NOTES ===
[2024-06-24]
- Improved folder selection logic for ZIP backups:
  - The script now scans all folders for the current date and fills any missing ZIP slots (1-100) in order, starting from the lowest group number.
  - Only when all folders for today are full (100 ZIPs each) will a new folder be created for additional backups.
  - Folders from previous dates are not affected; only today's folders are filled.

[2024-06-25]
- Added Discord webhook support for monitoring:
  - Sends progress, error, and status messages to a Discord channel using a webhook URL.
  - Webhook notifications can be turned on/off with the WEBHOOK_ENABLED variable at the top of the script.
  - Example messages: progress (X/100, folder name, zip name), errors, skips, and saves.
